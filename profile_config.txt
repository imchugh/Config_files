# Comments
# Under the profile and met items 'freq_mins', specify the measurement frequency of the 
# The rules:
#   - temperature data must be supplied for: i) the same number of levels as CO2; ii) a single level,  or;  
#     iii) no levels (i.e. temperature data is absent, in which case default 20C is used); 
#     nothing else will work!
#   - same goes for pressure data!
#   - level (i.e. measurement height) designations must be either contained in the variable names or specified 
#     under options below
#   - the 'bin_size' config item under 'options' refers to the number of observations, so if you have a 
#     2-minute measurement interval, a bin size of 2 means the data will be averaged across 2 intervals
#   - the 'lag' config item under 'options' allows the data to be shifted in time to allow for time delays
#     in the system
#   - if the required meteorological variables (temperature and pressure) are recorded at same frequency as 
#     profile data, include them in the profile sheet (i.e. move 'temp_vars' and 'p_vars' into the profile sheet)
#     and comment out the met sheet and all of its configs
